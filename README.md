# first-GAN
Generative Adversial Network based on FDF faces dataset obtained from exposing.ai. This Gan is capable of generating realistic human faces. The discriminator and Generator both work in tandem to produce images. The networks both consist of 7-8 convolutional layers along with leaky relu (0.2) to introduce non-linearity.
